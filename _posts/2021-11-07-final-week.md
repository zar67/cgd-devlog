This week I didn't do much as the Game Jam finished on Wednesday. I did however do some polishing and some bug fixes before we presented our game.

I improved the climbing up so that the player can jump up from a platform rather than just climbing down. I also setup the crouch animation to work when the player is in a pile of hay to improve how it looks.
