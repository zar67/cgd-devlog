We presented our game on Wednesday and got some final feedback from Andy and Simon as well as the other students in the room. Everyone also play tested our game which revealed some bugs and some design issues, which are as follows:

Good:
- There was good feedback regarding flow and difficulty.
- The climbing and jumping was well implemented.
- Felt immersive and intuitive.
- Fun mechanics and smooth gameplay.
- Excellent tutorial which allows for easy understanding.
- Simple and well-done controls.

Improvements/Bugs:
- Animations and movement are quite smooth which isn't realistic for an Atari game.
- The wall jumping seemed to be tricky for people to understand.
- The difficulty needs to be balanced better.
- There are bugs with the player's death. 
- The player can't jump up onto a platform from hanging.
- Level design needs improving and formulating.
- Some animations are delayed.
- Vision cones on the enemies seem odd to some people.
- The difficulty progression of the AI's movement speed needs fixing.
- There should be a static camera in the tutorial that follows the player to allow more time to figure out the movement.
- The score should increase with time played so the difficulty always increases even if the player stealthâ€™s around all the enemies.
- You can kill enemies through platforms.

We decided as a team to work on these throughout the rest of the year until the final submission.
