# Summary
In the reps meeting this week I raised the issue that my team doesn't have many tasks to get on with and therefore we have been tasked with merging together the systems for the Alpha next week. As a team we made the decision to meet on Monday and work through the day to merge things together. 

I started merging work on Friday by getting the resource generation, bases and combat systems working together. I created a new scene to be the main Game Scene and managed to setup a simple area with a few bases. 

This took me the marjority of the day to do and I ended up with a little prototype of the bases and the combat. There are still a few bugs with the systems but nothing that needs to be fixed before the alpha submission next week.

The player can move around the map and shoot, they can capture bases that aren't theirs and can interact with their bases to build defences. I also attempted to add in the resource generation into the GameScene, however after a discussion with the resources team, I realised I had refactored too much and they weren't happy with this, I reverted my changes and plan to merge their work on Monday in person with the team there as well. 

On Monday a few of the teams worked together to get things merged for the Alpha, and we managed to get the bases and resources easily together, but there wasn't much else for us to do as other teams were still working on completing their tasks and merging them.
