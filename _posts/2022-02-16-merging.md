# Summary
In the reps meeting this week I raised the issue that my team doesn't have many tasks to get on with and therefore we have been tasked with merging together the systems for the Alpha next week. As a team we made the decision to meet on Monday and work through the day to merge things together. 



# Next Steps
- Communicate with other reps for more tasks.
