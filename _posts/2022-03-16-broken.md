# Summary

This week I tried to start working on making the bases better using the models that had been added to the project. But due some recent changes, it was difficult to test. The following issues were:
- The interact action in the input actions had been deleted. 
- The game scene wasn't being loaded from the main menu but another testing scene.

I started by getting the game scene loaded up instead so I could actually move around and see the new bases. I also added back the interaction action and went through to set the references to it correctly again. 

Finally I then started building some new bases around the map just to get something better looking working for the Beta. This is when I realised that a new player prefab was being used that didn't have our Entity script on it and so none of our base interaction was working anymore. 

I waited until I could meet with a few of the other from the networking and player movement team to figure out what was going on and why we had a new player and managed to get something working correctly after some discussion.
