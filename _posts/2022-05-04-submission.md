# Summary

This week was final bug fixes and submission. We decided to have a code freeze in the main branch on Friday and then teams could work in their own branches if they had things to improve before the deadline. A lot of our capture code was changed on Friday, just before the deadline, I think due to some bugs that were found in it. I didn't know this was happening in time and so our capture work ended up not working correctly in develop, I spent some time fixing this as well as some other bugs that had arrisen with our turrets over the last week. 

The rest of the week I spend play-tesing and improving the game in our branch, including updating the UI interact prompts when turrets were build or damaged. 

I also tidyed up our code, making it more readable and understandable, and removed any redundant scripts from the project. 

Finally this week I prepared our submission, writing out the peer review, post-mortem and creating builds of all our games.
