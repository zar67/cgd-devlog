### Brief

- De-make a modern, popular title so it could theoretically play on the Atari 2600.
- Can use any game engine to make the game.
- Needs to have visuals and controls that would be realistic on an Atari 2600.
- An arcade style game, with no saves, to be played in one session.

### Summary

Our group started off with a list of games that we could possibly de-make and narrowed it down to Assassin's Creed.

After some discussion on day one about the design of the game we decided on: A 2D platformer with a focus on climbing and stealth. 
The player plays as an assassin and tries to avoid the sight of guards to get through the platforms.
The player recieves score based on how far they get and how many guards they kill but loses points if they're seen by the guards.

We also broke up the game into the major features and tasks to split them between everyone in the group. Here's what we decided:

- Level Generation - Stan
- Guard AI - Matt
- Movement - Zoe
- Combat - Liam
- Sprites - Zoe
- UI - Zoe
- Score - Liam
- Sound - Stan
- Camera - Zoe

After the main session, I spent some time designing the movement for the character and designing a sprite:

</p>

I designed the movement I wanted to create alonside some values for movement based on Celeste. I decided the player will be able to wall jump and hang from platforms as the two climbing abilities.I think this will give elements of Assassin's Creed's movement but on a simplified, 2D, scale. I brought my ideas to the group, and they agreed. 

After setting up the Unity project, I started working on the movement code. I setup a basic environment to test my movement in and added in my character sprite (without any animations yet).

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/jam-one/test-movement-setup.png" alt="Basic Test Environment Setup"/>
</p>

Setting up the movement was as simple as getting the input and applying a force based on speed and the input to the Rigidbody2D of the character. I also added a bit of smoothing to make the movement feel better.

{% highlight c# %}
  float move = m_movementInput * m_runSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
  Vector3 targetVelocity = new Vector2(move * 10f, m_rigidbody.velocity.y);
  m_rigidbody.velocity = Vector3.SmoothDamp(m_rigidbody.velocity, targetVelocity, ref m_velocity, m_movementSmoothingAmount);
{% endhighlight %}

I encountered an issue where the player would sometimes get stuck in the middle of a platform. This was because the platforms were made of individual tiles each with their own collider and so the player would get caught on the edge of tiles. To fix this I simply added a composite collider to the tilemap. 

Jumping was as simple as adding a check for whether the player is grounded, then adding a vertical force to the Rigidbody when the jump input is given. Hovever, I did improve the jump by adding a Mario style element - allowing the player to jump higher if they continue to press the jump input:

{% highlight c# %}
  if (m_rigidbody.velocity.y < 0)
  {
    m_rigidbody.velocity += Vector2.up * Physics2D.gravity * (m_fallMultiplier - 1) * Time.deltaTime;
  }
	else if (m_rigidbody.velocity.y > 0 && !m_jumpInput)
  {
    m_rigidbody.velocity += Vector2.up * Physics2D.gravity * (m_lowJumpMultiplier - 1) * Time.deltaTime;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

After the basic movement, I moved on to the more complex movement elements, starting with crouching. The player needs to be able to crouch down to one unit high to be able to hide in hay etc, however if they are crouching and can't stand up (e.g. the ceiling is too low) they need to stay crouching until they can stand up again, even if there isn't any crouch input. This is done by adding a Transform to use as a ceiling check point and using Physics2D.OverlapCircle to see if there is a ceiling above the player.

There are two colliders on the player, one covering the players head and upper body, one covering the lower body and legs. When crouching the top collider is disabled and eventually a crouching animation will be shown so the player is visually one unit tall.

I did come across some issues with the crouching where the player would become stuck in the collider of a platform when standing up underneath it, I added in some logic to check for a ceiling above the player and force the player to crouch if they canâ€™t stand up fully.

By the end of the first couple of days I had the basic movement for the character setup, meaning that it is easier for others in the group to test out their work.

Next, I implemented a wall jump where the player can slide down and jump off the wall. To do this I have a boolean value which determines if the player is close enough to a wall to 'grab', this is calculated by an OverlapCircle check with a transform placed at the front of the player. If a player can grab a wall and is moving into the wall they will 'grab' it, sliding down the wall at a reduced fall speed. When grabbing a wall, the player can use the jump key to launch off the wall away from it, this temporarily removes control from the player to make sure they get far enough away from the wall before control is regained.

This ended up being quite tricky to do and ended up with the player jumping up to the ceiling on several occasions due to bugs in the code. Eventually I managed to smooth everything out and while the wall jumping could do with improvement in the future the basics are in for now. 
 
{% highlight c# %}
if (m_isGrabbingWall)
{
    m_rigidbody.gravityScale = m_defaultGravityScale * m_wallGrabbingGravityMultiplier;
    m_rigidbody.velocity = Vector2.zero;

    if (m_jumpInput && m_jumpInputPressedThisFrame)
    {
        m_wallJumpTimer = m_wallJumpDuration;
        m_rigidbody.AddForce(new Vector2(-(m_movementInput * m_jumpForce), m_jumpForce * m_wallJumpHeightMultiplier));
        Flip();

        m_rigidbody.gravityScale = m_defaultGravityScale;
        m_isGrabbingWall = false;
        m_canControl = false;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

I also added idle and run animations to the player so that it looks much better when moving for the play test. The player character still looks a bit odd when sliding down a wall or crouching (as the player's head slides through the ceiling) but these animations will be improved in future.
