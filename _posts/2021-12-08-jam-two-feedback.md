# Summary
We presented our game on Wednesday and got some final feedback from Andy and Simon, mainly that we need to improve the feedback in our game and polish it.

# Improvements/Bugs
- Code cleanup.
- Tutorial section.
- Better sound effects.
- Firewall error fix.
- Movement animations.
- Movement and attack effects.
- Tank movement tracks.
- Attack animations.
- Delay between respawn (with UI).
- Disable path display is path longer than tiles can move.
- Improve path display visuals.
- Split UI into seperate scene with a game manager.

We decided as a team to work on these throughout the rest of the year until the final submission.
