# Summary
This week as a cohort started by deciding on Alpha, Beta, Gold deadlines for the project:
- Alpha - 22nd February
- Beta - 29th March
- Feature Freeze - 26th April
- Gold - 3rd May
- Presentation - 12th May

Next I started working on getting the project up and running. I created an empty unity project and added it into the git repo. I set this up with the new unity input system as requested by another team.

I then started on an API and a base prefab that other teams could begin to use, specifically the resources team. I created a BaseController script with a rank, type and team owner which gave the basic API needed for interaction with the base.
