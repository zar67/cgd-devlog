# Summary

This week was the beta submission, we managed to play the game but still have no end state and a lot of issues. We decided that my team would now be the play testing and user feel team, so we planned to meet the following Monday to play test the game and find as many issues as we could. 

During our play test we went through all the existing issues and closed any that we knew were now fixed or couldn't reproduce, we then went through the game and listed any bug and errors that we found. We also listed enhancement and player-feel issues such as the plane being too slow.
