### Brief
To de-make a modern, popular title so it could theoretically play on the Atari 2600.
Can use any game engine to make the game.
Needs to have visuals and controls that would be realistic on an Atari 2600.
An arcade style game, with no saves, to be played in one session.

### Summary
Our group started off with a list of games that we could possibly de-make and narrowed it down to Assassin's Creed.

After some discussion on day one about the design of the game we decided on: A 2D platformer with a focus on climbing and stealth. 
The player plays as an assassin and tries to avoid the sight of guards to get through the platforms.
The player scores based on how far they get and how many guards they kill, but loses points if they're seen by the guards.

We also broke up the game into the major features and tasks to split them between everyone in the group. Here's what we decided:

- Level Generation - Stan
- Guard AI - Matt
- Movement - Zoe
- Combat - Liam
- Sprites - Zoe
- UI - Zoe
- Score - Liam
- Sound - Stan
- Camera - Zoe

After the main session, I spent some time designing the movement for the character and also designing a sprite for the character (simply reducing the resolution of one I found online).

Here's the initial sprite I came up:

I came up with some metrics for the movement based on Celeste's character movement and jump and I also decided the two main climbing features to have in the game: wall jumping and hanging from platforms. I think this will give elements of Assassin's Creed's movement but on a simplified, 2D, scale. I brought my ideas to the group and they agreed.
