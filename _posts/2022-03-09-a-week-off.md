At the end of last week and this week I took some time away from uni for personal circumstances and so was not able to attend the weekly meeting. However I did attempt to do some work at home, and mostly focused on fixing issues with our work. 

Due to merging errors our base prefabs were broken and so I spent some time fixing those and getting those running again. I also fixed a bug with the capturing where in the cooldown state, teams could begin contesting a base without waiting for the cooldown to drop to zero. 

I wanted to achieve more this week, however there were so many bugs in the game that testing was rather difficult.

We did start discussing UI design and managed to come up with a design for the HUD, which looks pretty good. There needs to be come coordination next week on who will be implementing this design though.
