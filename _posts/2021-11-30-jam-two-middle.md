# Summary
We got all the functionality working before the first playtest, but we didn't get it all merged together, meaning we weren't able to fully test our game. However, most of the Networking and the big tasks are either completed or near complete which puts us in a good position for the coming weeks. Andy liked what we had produced but encouraged us to get it all merged.

Andy also mentioned player types to all the groups and got us thinking about how our game would appeal (or not appeal) to each player type: Killer, Achiever, Socialiser and Explorer.

Our game mostly fits all four categories due to the following mechanics:
Killer: Taking over other player's colonies.
Achiever: The challenges and leader board encourage players to get higher scores.
Socailiser: The game is multiplayer, so you play with a friend.
Explorer: Move around the map to discover the whole map.

This week I focused on fixing the bugs in the world generation and helping the other with getting the world generation hooked up to the combat and the networking systems.

There were some bugs with the path finding function as well as some features requested from the others such as being able to select which terrain types a unit can traverse.

On Monday, I spent some time merging everything together so that we had a working game loop where two players can connect and take their turns. 

I also added a Fog of War to the map to engage Explorer player types more.
