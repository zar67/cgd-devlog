### Tasks
- Begin a development log of work and tasks
- Create an initial idea for the project
- Refine idea into a project proposal

### Summary
Following the pre-summer introductory lecture, where a brief overview of the module and what to expect was covered, I created a brief initial proposal for two potential project ideas:
- A sex education-based game
- A scout badges-based app

This proposal can be found here: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/initial_proposal.pdf" target="_blank">Initial Project Proposal.pdf</a>

I asked Lloyd to be my supervisor and concluded on the sex education-based game for my project.

I also created this development log to record how the project progresses as well as to track tasks and feedback.

In summary I want to create an engaging and helpful educational game aimed to help teach secondary school children sex education. I want my project to fulfil three main requirements: inclusive, comfortable, enjoyable.

### Next Steps
- Begin research into gamification
